# 2nd homework - Xtext

## Steps for solving the homework

1. The [initial](https://github.com/MDSDLab/mdsd-2024-xtext-hw) repo contains the result of [Preparing the projects](../../practice/practice_03/PR3-Xtext-Projects.pdf) belonging to the Xtext practice with some extra configurations so that the projects can also be built by Maven. Copy the **statemachine.dsl.parent** folder to the root of your own repo!
2. Open the projects under the **statemachine.dsl.parent** folder in Eclipse!
3. Solve the [Xtext practice](../../practice/practice_03/PR3-Xtext-Guideline.pdf) based on these projects!
4. **Extend the result of the practice based on the description below!**
5. Mark your last commit with a **hw2-xtext** tag!
