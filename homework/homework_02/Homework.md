# 2nd homework - Xtext

## Steps for solving the homework

1. The [initial](https://github.com/MDSDLab/mdsd-2024-xtext-hw) repo contains the result of [Preparing the projects](../../practice/practice_03/PR3-Xtext-Projects.pdf) belonging to the Xtext practice with some extra configurations so that the projects can also be built by Maven. Copy the contents of the initial repo into your own repo under a newly created folder called **StateMachineDsl**!
2. Solve the [Xtext practice](../../practice/practice_03/PR3-Xtext-Guideline.pdf) based on these projects!
3. **Extend the result of the practice based on the description below!**
4. Mark your last commit with a **hw2-xtext** tag!
